          and scripting, I bring a wealth of experience to every project.</p>

        <p>My expertise lies in crafting robust REST APIs, implementing secure authentication mechanisms (including

          Currently a second-year Computer Science (B.Tech) student at UVCE, where I'm actively engaged as a member of
          the core technical team at GDSC UVCE. Leading engaging study jams for my peers is both a pleasure and a
          privilege.

          I embrace the art of competitive programming to keep my cognitive faculties (brain) sharp. You can find me navigating
          the competitive coding realm under the alias "maxus_red" on Codeforces â€“ drop by for a stimulating coding
          journey!

          "Normal is an illusion. What is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly." So, don't conform to the ordinary! Instead, pursue what ignites your passion. Push your boundaries to discover your happiness.
